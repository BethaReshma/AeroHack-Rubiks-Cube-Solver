# AeroHack-Rubiks-Cube-Solver
The Canvas contains a Python script for a Rubik's Cube solver. It uses a Cube class to model a 3x3 cube's state and moves. The solve function demonstrates a step-by-step, layer-by-layer solving strategy. Users can choose to start with a random scramble or provide a custom state. The code serves as a foundational and logical implementation.
