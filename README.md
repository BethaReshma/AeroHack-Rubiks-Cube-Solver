AeroHack'25: Rubik's Cube Solver ðŸ§©:
This Python project is a Rubik's Cube solver algorithm designed to solve a standard 3x3x3 cube from any scrambled state. The solution uses a logical, human-like, layer-by-layer method, implemented within a Cube class to model the cube's state and transitions. The code is structured to be both functional and easy to understand, with functions for all standard cube moves.

Features:
Cube Modeling: Uses a Cube class to represent the 3x3 cube's state with a dictionary of faces.
Move Engine: Implements a full set of standard moves (U, D, F, B, L, R and their inverses) to simulate cube rotations.
Input Flexibility: Allows the user to choose between a randomly scrambled cube or providing a custom starting state.
Solving Strategy: Applies a simplified layer-by-layer approach to find a solution.

How to Run:
Save the code as a Python file (e.g., rubik_solver.py).
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
Run the script using the command: python rubik_solver.py
Follow the on-screen prompts to choose between a random or custom scrambled state.
